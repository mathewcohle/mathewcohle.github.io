      <description>Recently, I read the book The Art of Living: Vipassana Meditation. There is chapter called The Two Rings1 describing story which goes something like this:
 Two brothers inherit the property after death of father. Later on, they get into a fight and decide to split all the property equally &amp;ndash; except packet with two rings, one expensive and the other just regular silver ring. The older brother argues his way to take the expensive one.</description>
