      <description>If you are asked to do something, do it unconditionally &amp;ndash; without expecting anything in return. No more scratching back only if you scratch mine.
Doing the favor conditionally builds an expectation which either ends with things going as expected or being disappointment if the promise is not fulfilled. Thus, it is equivalent of the trade with small upside but rather large downside. Lot of sadness around the world could disappear with better expectation management.</description>

      <description>Recently, I read the book The Art of Living: Vipassana Meditation. There is chapter called The Two Rings1 describing story which goes something like this:
 Two brothers inherit the property after death of father. Later on, they get into a fight and decide to split all the property equally &amp;ndash; except packet with two rings, one expensive and the other just regular silver ring. The older brother argues his way to take the expensive one.</description>

      <description>Controlled Cold Exposures After reading about Wim Hof, it was no-brainer to at least give it a shot. So far I&amp;rsquo;ve been:
 doing cold water immersion &amp;ndash; full body, water temperature 10-4 Â°C, time in water between 1&amp;mdash;2 minutes walking bare foot in the snow wearing fewer clothes in the winter  Experimenting With Lower Carbohydrates Intake It was sad moment to realize after following dietary discussion for a couple of months that still the best advice regarding one diet is to simply experiment and observe what works for you.</description>
